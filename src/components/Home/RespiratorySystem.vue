                The human gas-exchanging organ, the lung, is located in the thorax, where its delicate tissues are protected by the bony and muscular thoracic cage. The lung provides the tissues of the human body with a continuous flow of oxygen and clears the blood of the gaseous waste product, carbon dioxide.
                Atmospheric air is pumped in and out regularly through a system of pipes, called conducting airways, which join the gas-exchange region with the outside of the body. The airways can be divided into upper and lower airway systems. The transition between the two systems is located where the pathways of the respiratory and digestive systems cross, just at the top of the larynx.

            <h4 class="text-start">What are Respiratory System Disorders?</h4>
            <p class="text-start">A disorder is defined as a state of irregular functioning of the body. Respiratory system disorders or respiratory diseases are the medical terms used to study the various types of infections, allergies and other diseases related to the different organs, tissues and specialized cells of the human respiratory system.</p>
            <p class="text-start">The respiratory system mainly consists of the upper respiratory tract, alveoli, bronchi, bronchioles, trachea, pleura, and pleural cavity. The common cold is an example of a mild respiratory disorder and other serious and life-threatening respiratory disorders include pneumonia, lung cancer and asthma, influenza, tuberculosis, etc.</p>
            <h4 class="text-start">Factors Affecting Respiratory System Disorders</h4>
            <p class="text-start">There are several factors associated with respiratory system disorders. A few of these factors include:</p>
            <ul class="text-start">
                <li>Genetics</li>
                <li>Allergies</li>
                <li>Smoking</li>
                <li>Air Pollution</li>
                <li>Bacterial and viral infections.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4 class="text-start">Types of Respiratory System Disorders</h4>
            <p class="text-start">Respiratory system disorders affect millions of people worldwide. There are three main types of respiratory diseases:</p>
            <ul class="text-start">
                <li><strong>Airway Disease </strong>  It affects the bronchial tubes which function by transporting oxygen and other gases in and out of the lungs. In airway disease, the passage for air is reduced, which is associated either with narrowing or blocking of bronchial tubes.</li>
                <li><strong>Lung Tissue Disease</strong> Human lungs are covered by a thin tissue layer called the pleura. Due to certain viral or bacterial infections, the structure of the lung tissues is affected, which results in scarring or inflammation of the tissue that enables the lungs to expand normally and in turn, makes breathing difficult.</li>
                <li><strong>Lung Circulation Disease</strong> This disorder occurs when the blood vessels of the lungs are coagulated, swollen or damaged. This affects the ability of the lungs to receive oxygen and release carbon dioxide. In extreme cases, this disorder may affect the functioning of the heart.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4 class="text-start">Causes of Respiratory Disorders</h4>
            <p class="text-start">Respiratory diseases are caused due to exposure to pollutants, smoking, passively inhaling tobacco smoke, asbestos, radon, etc.</p>
            <h4 class="text-start">Respiratory Diseases</h4>
            <p class="text-start">Following are the major respiratory disorders or diseases:</p>
            <ul class="text-start">
                <li><strong> Asthma </strong>is a chronic disease which affects the bronchi and bronchioles of the lungs. It causes difficulty in breathing and is followed by severe cough, restlessness, cough and a wheezing sound while breathing.
                    <p class="text-start">Asthma might cause due to the following factors:</p>
                    <ul class="text-start">
                        <li>Cold air</li>
                        <li>Airborne allergens</li>
                        <li>Respiratory infections</li>
                        <li>Physical activity</li>
                        <li>Air pollutants</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong> Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).</strong> This includes all the respiratory diseases that cause breathlessness or the inability to exhale. It largely affects people who have been exposed to some sort of smoke. It is a very serious disease and worsens even if you stop smoking.</li>
                <li><strong> Emphysema</strong> is defined as a chronic disease, reduction of the respiratory surface due to damage to the lung alveolar walls. It is caused mainly by cigarette smoking. The main symptoms of emphysema include shortness of breath and cough. Emphysema might lead to a loss of elasticity of the lungs.
                    <p class="text-start">Emphysema may be caused by the following factors:</p>
                    <ul class="text-start">
                        <li>Dust</li>
                        <li>Chemicals</li>
                        <li>Air pollution</li>
                        <li>Smoking tobacco</li>
                        <li>Exposure to passive cigarette smoking</li>
                    </ul>
 
                </li>
                <li><strong> Occupational respiratory disorders</strong> are defined as any disorder which affects the respiratory system by long-term inhalation of chemicals, proteins, and dust. For instance, Asbestosis is caused by the inhalation of asbestos dust.
                    <p class="text-start">Occupational respiratory disorders might happen due to the inhalation of the following substances:</p>
                    <ul class="text-start">
                        <li>Fumes from metals.</li>
                        <li>Smoke from burning organic materials.</li>
                        <li>Sprays of varnish, paint, acids, and pesticides.</li>
                        <li>Dust from cotton, silica, coal, drug powders and pesticides.</li>
                        <li>Gases from industries. For instance, Ammonia, chlorine and nitrogen oxides.</li>
                    </ul>
 
                </li>
                <li><strong> Sinusitis.</strong> It is the inflammation of the mucous membranes in the nasal sinus. The mucous membranes produce mucus that drains into the nasal cavities. Bacterial or viral infections or some airborne allergens cause the inflammation of the mucous membranes.</li>
                <li><strong>Lung cancer</strong> can develop in any part of the lungs. It occurs in the main part of the lungs. The treatment of lung cancer depends upon the type, location and its spread.</li>
            </ul>
