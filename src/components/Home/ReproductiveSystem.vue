                The reproductive system of an organism, also known as the genital system, is the biological system made up of all the anatomical organs involved in sexual reproduction. Many non-living substances such as fluids, hormones, and pheromones are also important accessories to the reproductive system.
                Unlike most organ systems, the sexes of differentiated species often have significant differences. These differences allow for a combination of genetic material between two individuals, which allows for the possibility of greater genetic fitness of the offspring.

            <h4 class="text-start">What common diseases occur in the female reproductive system?</h4>
            <p class="text-start">Female reproductive system diseases are considered to be all those that occur in the vagina, cervix and uterus, breasts, or ovaries.</p>
            <p class="text-start">This type of diseases can have different origins, ranging from poor hygiene, the existence of fungi, or even genetic or hereditary factors. Although female reproductive system diseases can arise at any stage of life, it is very common that, after the age of 40, the moment in which they go through menopause, they appear more frequently.</p>
            <p class="text-start">Among the common female reproductive system diseases are:</p>
            <ul class="text-start">
                <li><strong>Cervical Cancer.</strong> Also known as uterine cancer, it occurs most often in women who are obese or during the first stage of menopause.</li>
                <li><strong>Breast cancer. </strong>It originates in breast tissue and there are different types depending on its origin.</li>
                <li><strong>Vaginal yeast infection. </strong>It is one of the most common diseases and is caused by a fungus that arises due to the alteration of the pH of the vaginal discharge or a weak immune system.</li>
                <li><strong>Endometriosis.</strong> In the presence of tissue similar to the endometrium, it causes chronic inflammation and irregular menstruation.</li>
                <li><strong>STD.</strong> Although sexually transmitted diseases affect both men and women, in many cases in women they can cause more serious symptoms or complications.</li>
                <li><strong>Urinary infections.</strong> Due to the presence of bacteria in the urethra, this infection can result in cystitis or pyelonephritis.</li>
                <li><strong>Uterine prolapse.</strong> Alteration of the pelvic ligaments that results in the lack of adequate support in the uterus.</li>
                <li><strong>Ovarian cyst.</strong> Although some cysts may disappear on their own, they can cause complications if they donâ€™t.</li>
                <li><strong> HPV. </strong>The human papillomavirus is one of the most common pathologies and can cause warts on the sexual organs or promote the development of cancer.</li>
