                Skin is the largest organ in the body and covers the body's entire external surface. It is made up of three layers, the epidermis, dermis, and the hypodermis, all three of which vary significantly in their anatomy and function. The skin's structure is made up of an intricate network which serves as the body’s initial barrier against pathogens, UV light, and chemicals, and mechanical injury.
                It also regulates temperature and the amount of water released into the environment.Skin is the layer of usually soft, flexible outer tissue covering the body of a vertebrate animal, with three main functions: protection, regulation, and sensation.

            <h4 class="text-start">Skin Diseases</h4>
            <p class="text-start">Skin diseases are conditions that affect your skin. These diseases may cause rashes, inflammation, itchiness or other skin changes. Some skin conditions may be genetic, while lifestyle factors may cause others. Skin disease treatment may include medications, creams or ointments, or lifestyle changes.</p>
            <h4 class="text-start">What are skin diseases?</h4>
            <p class="text-start">Your skin is the large organ that covers and protects your body. Your skin has many functions. It works to:</p>
            <ul class="text-start">
                <li>Hold in fluid and prevent dehydration.</li>
                <li>Help you feel sensations, such as temperature or pain.</li>
                <li>Keep out bacteria, viruses and other causes of infection.</li>
                <li>Stabilize your body temperature.</li>
                <li>Synthesize (create) vitamin D in response to sun exposure.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-start">Skin diseases include all conditions that clog, irritate or inflame your skin. Often, skin diseases cause rashes or other changes in your skin’s appearance.</p>
            <h4 class="text-start">What are the most common types of skin diseases?</h4>
            <p class="text-start">Some skin diseases are minor. Others cause severe symptoms. Some of the most common skin diseases include:</p>
            <ul class="text-start">
                <li><strong> Acne,</strong> blocked skin follicles that lead to oil, bacteria and dead skin buildup in your pores.</li>
                <li><strong>Alopecia areata,</strong> losing your hair in small patches.</li>
                <li><strong>Atopic dermatitis (eczema),</strong> dry, itchy skin that leads to swelling, cracking or scaliness.</li>
                <li><strong>Psoriasis,</strong> scaly skin that may swell or feel hot.</li>
                <li><strong>Raynaud’s phenomenon,</strong> periodic reduced blood flow to your fingers, toes or other body parts, causing numbness or skin color change.</li>
                <li><strong>Rosacea, flushed,</strong> thick skin and pimples, usually on the face.</li>
                <li><strong>Skin cancer,</strong> uncontrolled growth of abnormal skin cells.</li>
                <li><strong>Vitiligo,</strong> patches of skin that lose pigment.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4 class="text-start">What are some types of rare skin diseases?</h4>
            <p class="text-start">Many rare skin diseases are genetic, meaning you inherit them. Some rare skin diseases include:</p>
            <ul class="text-start">
                <li><strong>Actinic prurigo (AP),</strong> itchy rash in response to sun exposure.</li>
                <li><strong>Argyria,</strong> changes in skin color due to silver buildup in your body.</li>
                <li><strong>Chromhidrosis,</strong> colored sweat.</li>
                <li><strong>Epidermolysis bullosa,</strong> a connective tissue disorder that causes fragile skin that blisters and tears easily.</li>
                <li><strong>Harlequin ichthyosis,</strong> thick, hard patches or plates on the skin that are present at birth.</li>
                <li><strong>Lamellar ichthyosis,</strong> waxy skin layer that sheds in the first few weeks of life, revealing scaly, red skin.</li>
                <li><strong>Necrobiosis lipoidica,</strong> rash on the lower legs that can develop into ulcers (sores).</li>
            </ul>
            <h4 class="text-start">What causes skin diseases?</h4>
            <p class="text-start">Certain lifestyle factors can lead to the development of a skin disease. Underlying health conditions may affect your skin, too. Common causes of skin diseases include:</p>
            <ul class="text-start">
                <li>Bacteria trapped in your pores or hair follicles.</li>
                <li>Conditions that affect your thyroid, kidneys or immune system.</li>
                <li>Contact with environmental triggers, such as allergens or another person’s skin.</li>
                <li>Genetics</li>
                <li>Fungus or parasites living on your skin.</li>
                <li>Medications, such as the ones that treat inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).</li>
                <li>Viruses.</li>
                <li>Diabetes.</li>
                <li>Sun.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4 class="text-start">What are the symptoms of skin diseases?</h4>
            <p class="text-start">Skin disease symptoms vary significantly, depending on what condition you have. Skin changes are not always due to skin diseases. For example, you may get a blister from wearing ill-fitting shoes. However, when skin changes show up with no known cause, they may be linked to an underlying condition.</p>
            <p class="text-start">Generally, skin diseases may cause:</p>
            <ul class="text-start">
                <li>Discolored skin patches (abnormal pigmentation).</li>
                <li>Dry skin.</li>
                <li>Open sores, lesions or ulcers.</li>
                <li>Peeling skin.</li>
                <li>Rashes, possibly with itchiness or pain.</li>
                <li>Red, white or pus-filled bumps.</li>
                <li>Scaly or rough skin.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4 class="text-start">How can I prevent skin diseases?</h4>
            <p class="text-start">Some skin diseases are not preventable. For example, there is no way to change your genetics or prevent an autoimmune disorder.</p>
            <p class="text-start">You can take steps to avoid contagious or infectious skin diseases. You may prevent contagious skin diseases or reduce their symptoms if you:</p>
            <ul class="text-start">
                <li>Avoid sharing utensils, personal items or cosmetics.</li>
                <li>Disinfect objects you use in public spaces, such as gym equipment.</li>
                <li>Drink plenty of water and eat a nutritious diet.</li>
                <li>Limit contact with irritants or harsh chemicals.</li>
                <li>Sleep seven to eight hours per night.</li>
                <li>Use sun protection to prevent sunburn and other sun damage.</li>
                <li>Wash your hands regularly with soap and water.</li>
            </ul>
