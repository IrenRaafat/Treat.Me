                The human digestive system consists of the gastrointestinal tract plus the accessory organs of digestion (the tongue, salivary glands, pancreas, liver, and gallbladder). Digestion involves the breakdown of food into smaller and smaller components, until they can be absorbed and assimilated into the body.
                The process of digestion has three stages: the cephalic phase, the gastric phase, and the intestinal phase.

            <h4 class="text-start">How can I keep my digestive system healthy?</h4>
            <p class="text-start">If you have a medical condition, always ask your healthcare provider what you should do and eat to stay healthy and manage your condition. In general, the following are ways to keep your digestive system healthy:</p>
            <ul class="text-start">
                <li><strong> Drink water often:</strong> Water helps the food you eat flow more easily through your digestive system. Low amounts of water in your body (dehydration) is a common cause of constipation.</li>
                <li><strong>Include fiber in your diet:</strong> Fiber is beneficial to digestion and helps your body have regular bowel movements. Be sure to incorporate both soluble and insoluble fiber into your diet.</li>
                <li><strong>Eat a balanced diet:</strong> Be sure to eat several servings of fruit and vegetables every day. Choose whole grains over processed grains and try to avoid processed foods in general. Choose poultry and fish more often than red meat and limit all deli (processed) meats. Limit the amount of sugar you consume.</li>
                <li><strong>Eat foods with probiotics or take probiotic supplements:</strong> Probiotics are good bacteria that help fight off the bad bacteria in your gut. They also make healthy substances that nourish your gut. It can be especially helpful to consume probiotics after you have taken an antibiotic because antibiotics often kill both bad and good bacteria in your gut.</li>
                <li><strong>Eat mindfully and chew your food:</strong> Eating slowly gives your body time to digest your food properly. It also allows your body to send you cues that it is full. It is important to chew your food thoroughly because it helps to ensure your body has enough saliva (spit) for digestion. Chewing your food fully also makes it easier for your digestive system to absorb the nutrients in the food.</li>
                <li><strong>Exercise:</strong> Physical activity and gravity help move food through your digestive system. Taking a walk, for example, after you eat a meal can help your body digest the food more easily.</li>
                <li><strong>Avoid alcohol and smoking:</strong> Alcohol can increase the amount of acid in your stomach and can cause heartburn, acid reflux and stomach ulcers. Smoking almost doubles your risk of having acid reflux. Research has shown that people who have digestive issues that quit smoking have improved symptoms.</li>
                <li><strong>Manage your stress:</strong> Stress is associated with digestive issues such as constipation, diarrhea and IBS.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4 class="text-start">Healthcare providers who treat digestive system disorders</h4>
            <P class="text-start">Many health care providers can help diagnose and treat digestive problems.
