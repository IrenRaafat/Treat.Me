                The nervous system is a complex network of nerves and cells that carry messages to and from the brain and spinal cord to various parts of the body. The proper functioning of these nerves ensures that each organ system, such as the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and immune systems, can adequately communicate with one another.
 
The nervous system includes the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS). The CNS is made up of the brain and spinal cord, whereas the PNS is made up of the somatic and autonomic nervous systems.

            <h4 class="text-start">Healthcare providers who treat nervous system disorders</h4>
            <p class="text-start">The best way to manage nervous system disorders is with the help of a team of healthcare providers. You may not need all members of the team at any given time. But it's good to know who they are and how they can help. Here is a list of some of the healthcare providers that may be involved in treating nervous system disorders:</p>
            <ul class="text-start">
                <li><strong>Neurologist.</strong> The medical healthcare providers who diagnose and treat nervous system disorders are called neurologists. Some neurologists treat acute strokes and cerebral aneurysms using endovascular techniques.</li>
                <li><strong>Neurosurgeon.</strong> Surgeons who operate as a treatment team for nervous system disorders are called neurological surgeons or neurosurgeons.</li>
                <li><strong>Neuroradiologist and interventional radiologist.</strong> This is a radiologist who specializes in diagnosing nervous system conditions using imaging and in treating nervous system conditions such as cerebral aneurysms, acute strokes, and vertebral fractures. This provider also does biopsies of certain tumors.</li>
                <li><strong>Psychologist.</strong> Emotional problems such as anxiety, depression, mood swings, and irritability are common in nervous system disorders. Your psychologist can help. Psychologists may do testing to find out how much your disorder is affecting the way you think and feel. Psychologists also do talk therapy (counseling) to help you deal with the emotional effects caused by nervous system disorders.</li>
                <li><strong>Psychiatrist.</strong> Like your psychologist, this team member deals with emotional and behavior symptoms caused by nervous system disorders. In most cases, talk therapy works best for these problems. But if you need medicines to treat symptoms such as depression or anxiety, this doctor can help</li>
                <li><strong>Physiatrist.</strong> Healthcare providers who work with people in the rehab (rehabilitation) process are called physiatrists.</li>
                <li><strong>Physical therapist.</strong> This is a movement specialist who can help you move and walk well. In physical therapy, you can also work on painful or stiff muscles and joints.</li>
                <li><strong>Occupational therapist.</strong> This provider helps you learn to handle your day-to-day activities. For example, you might have trouble doing tasks you need to do at work or at home. Your occupational therapist will help you find ways to adjust to any changes in your physical abilities.</li>
                <li><strong>Speech/language pathologist.</strong> This provider specializes in communication, including cognitive communication. They also diagnose and treat swallowing problems.</li>
