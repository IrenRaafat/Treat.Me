          <p>Humans are born into social groups and live their entire lives as a part of society
          so the social element can’t easily be removed from the evolution of an individual. But how does social contact affect our health?

          As human beings, we dream, learn, grow, and work as part of society. The society that we’re born into and the societies that we navigate throughout our lives shape our personal identities.

          And in fact, so keen are we to communicate with each other — even beyond geographical limitations — that we’ve developed a plethora of tools to help us achieve that, including pen and paper, telegraph, telephone, and the Internet.

            When I asked my colleagues in the Medical News Today office what benefits — if any — they thought that they derived from social connection, most of them said that they found some measure of comfort in social interaction

          Some colleagues said that they enjoyed the shared experiences, whereas others explained that friends kept them motivated to do “some healthful activities from time to time.” Others said that being around friends helped them to “destress and put things into perspective.”

          Even the most introverted among us crave social contact from time to time. But why is that, and does being social bring us any actual health benefits?

          In this Spotlight, we investigate why humans thrive in society, and how social interaction impacts our mental and physical well-being.

          <p>Research has shown that by interacting with others, we actually train our brains.
          Social motivation and social contact can help to improve memory formation and recall and protects the brain from neurodegenerative diseases.

          Prof. Matthew Lieberman — from the University of California, Los Angeles — specializes in the mechanics of what he calls our “social brain,” which is the neural activity related to social interaction, and the brain benefits that are afforded by it.</p>

              Social context determines healthful habits
            </h3>
            <p>
              Several recent studies have also linked social connection with physical health benefits, and better habits with a more healthful lifestyle.
          Researchers at Maastricht University Medical Centre in the Netherlands saw that socially active individuals have a decreased risk of type 2 diabetes

          In contrast, individuals who did not participate in social activities, such as going out with friends or joining a club, had a 60 percent higher risk of developing a condition called “prediabetes,” which generally predates diabetes.

          It might be that just being around people who encourage us to keep healthful habits or achieve challenging lifestyle goals could help us to remain mindful of our eating, exercise, and other lifestyle-related habits.

          A recent study has also found that people who exercised in a group rather than on their own had decreased stress levels and had better mental and physical well-being at the end of a 12-week fitness program.

          Their peers who went for solo fitness sessions, or who exercised with only one partner, did not experience the same improvements.

          “The communal benefits of coming together with friends and colleagues, and doing something difficult, while encouraging one another, pays dividends beyond exercising alone,” notes the study’s lead author.
